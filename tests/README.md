Place the source code (`my_shell.c`) in this testing directory. Run the following command.

```bash
./master.sh my_shell.c
```

This script will in turn invoke separate shell scripts for parts A, B, CD of the project. Each script will run a set of test cases on the code and print out the result of the tests. The output will verify the code.
